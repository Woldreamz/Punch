# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



Certainly! Below is the overview and documentation for the implementation of the key components in your codebase, highlighting notable decisions and challenges faced during the development process.

### Overview and Documentation

#### [src/components/Banner.jsx](src/components/Banner.jsx#L1)
The `Banner` component is responsible for displaying a promotional banner. It is a simple, stateless component that is used within the [`App`](src/App.jsx#L2) component. 

#### Notable Decisions:
- The `Banner` component is designed to be reusable across different parts of the application.
- It is wrapped in an `Animation` component in the [`App`](src/App.jsx#L17) to provide a fade-in-left animation effect.

#### [src/components/CompScreening.jsx](src/components/CompScreening.jsx#L1)
The `CompScreening` (Comprehensive Screening) component is used to display comprehensive screening information. It imports another component, [`TheJourney`](src/components/CompScreening.jsx#L2), and leverages state management to handle user interactions.

#### Notable Decisions:
- Use of `useState` hook to manage component state for handling dynamic content like icons.
- The component is also wrapped in an `Animation` component in the [`App`](src/App.jsx#L31) to provide a fade-in-left animation effect.

#### Challenges:
- Managing the state effectively to ensure the correct icon (dark or white play icon) is displayed based on user interactions.
- Ensuring smooth animations without affecting the performance of the application.

#### [src/components/TheJourney.jsx](src/components/TheJourney.jsx#L1)
The `TheJourney` component is a part of the `CompScreening` component, providing a detailed journey of the screening process.

#### Notable Decisions:
- The component is modularly designed to be embedded within the `CompScreening` component.

#### [src/components/Animation.jsx](src/components/Animation.jsx#L1)
The `Animation` component is a higher-order component (HOC) that provides various animations to its child components. It is used extensively in the [`App`](src/App.jsx#L1, #17, #20, #25, #28, #31, #34, #37) component to enhance user experience.

#### Notable Decisions:
- The use of a single animation component to handle multiple animation types (`fade-in-left`, `fade-in-bottom`, etc.) ensures consistency and reusability.
- The component abstracts away the complexity of animations, making it easy to apply animations to any child component.

#### Challenges:
- Ensuring that the animations are performant and do not cause jank or lag in the user interface.
- Handling different types of animations within a single component required careful design and testing.

#### [src/components/marketsquare/RightSpace.jsx](src/components/marketsquare/RightSpace.jsx#L1)
The `RightSpace` component is part of the `marketsquare` directory, intended to display the right-side content. This component is not directly used in the main [`App`](src/App.jsx#L1) component but might be used in other parts of the application.

#### [src/App.jsx](src/App.jsx#L1)
The `App` component is the main entry point of the application. It imports and uses multiple components including [`Animation`](src/App.jsx#L1), [`Banner`](src/App.jsx#L2), [`Comprehensive`](src/App.jsx#L3), and others.

#### Notable Decisions:
- The `App` component organizes the structure of the application by importing and using various child components.
- Extensive use of the `Animation` component to enhance user experience with smooth animations.

#### Challenges:
- Ensuring that the structure of the `App` component is modular and maintainable.
- Coordinating animations across multiple components to ensure a cohesive user experience.

### Example Code

Here is an example of how the `Animation` component is used within the `App` component to wrap other components and provide animations:

```type:Quoted,lang:JavaScript,path:src/App.jsx,lines:17-40
<Animation animation="fade-in-left">
  <Banner />
</Animation>
<Animation animation="fade-in-bottom">
  <Hero />
</Animation>
<Animation animation="fade-in-left">
  <Comprehensive />
</Animation>
<Animation animation="fade-in-bottom">
  <FeatureLight />
</Animation>
<Animation animation="fade-in-left">
  <FreqAskQues />
</Animation>
<Footer />
```


This demonstrates the modular and reusable design of the components, as well as the use of a higher-order component to provide animations.
