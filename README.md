# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Implementation Overview of the `CompScreening` Component

## 1. Introduction
The `CompScreening` component is designed to provide an interactive UI for displaying a list of screening steps. Each step can be expanded or collapsed by the user.

## 2. State Management
State management is handled using the `useState` hook from React. This allows the component to manage its own local state in a functional component.

## 3. Component Structure
The component is structured into three main parts:
- State Initialization: `const [openItem, setOpenItem] = useState(null);`
- State Update Function: `const toggleHandler = (id) => { setOpenItem((prev) => (prev === id ? null : id)); };`
- JSX Rendering: Conditional rendering based on the `openItem` state.

## 4. User Interaction Logic
The `toggleHandler` function allows users to expand or collapse a screening step by clicking on it. This function updates the `openItem` state, which controls the visibility of the step details.

## 5. Conditional Rendering
Conditional rendering is used to dynamically display the details of a screening step based on whether it is expanded or collapsed. This is achieved by checking the `openItem` state.

## 6. Styling Decisions
CSS classes are toggled dynamically based on the state to change the appearance of expanded items. This enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback.

## 7. Challenges Faced
- Ensuring smooth state transitions to provide a seamless user experience.
- Managing the dynamic application of CSS classes based on the component state.

## 8. Conclusion
The implementation of the `CompScreening` component effectively uses the `useState` hook for state management, conditional rendering for user interaction, and dynamic styling to enhance the user experience.
